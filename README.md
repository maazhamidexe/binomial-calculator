# binomial-calculator
This program takes in n,p and limits of x, and then calculates the probability in those limits. I wrote this code because i was too lazy to use calculator so many times for my assignment


Functions:
fact(): this function takes in a single variable as argument and through a for loop, it multuplies the number with 'i' which is incrementing.

powe(): this function multiplies the base with itself until the 'i' reachess exponent's value.

comb(): this function calculates the combinations through the formula n!/(n-r)!(r)!. It calls fact() function to do so.

Main(): Here it takes values from the user and through the formula of bernoulli process, it calculates the probability through loops and calling functions.
